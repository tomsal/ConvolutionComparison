# ConvolutionComparison

## Task
This repository contains the results of my job as a research assistant at the Heidelberg Collaboratory for Image Processing.
The task was to evaluate and compare the performance of (ArrayFire's)[https://arrayfire.com/] convolution implemented on the GPU with (VIGRA's)[https://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/] CPU implementation.

## Results

Folder `report` contains the timing results. Folders `python/gaussian_comparison`, `python/hessianOfGaussian_comparison` and `cpp/comparison` contain the code used for evaluation.
